# Intro_To_TensorFlow_Notebooks

The aim of this repository is to provide a comprehensive guide for TensorFlow introduction. Data from Google BigQuery is used and downloaded as CSV. As a reference, you can start with the '0. Preparation.ipynb' notebook.

Before getting started, one needs to Install Anaconda for your OS. You can directly download it from https://www.continuum.io/downloads.

After installing Anaconda, open a command prompt and test by running the following command: jupyter-notebook. A successful execution of this command should open a browser window.

Once done, close the browser, then hit Ctrl+C on your command prompt and run the following command: pip install tensorflow.

If everything is set up correctly, you can clone this repository and run jupyter-notebook from the folder where you downloaded the repo.

This repository is built based on the notebooks originally available from another source.
